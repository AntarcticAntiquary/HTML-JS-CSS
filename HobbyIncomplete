        	<h3>About the harp</h3>
        	<p>Harps are one of the oldest musical instruments, attested in archaeology from 3500BC in Ancient Mesopotamia. The modern mid-size harp (called either the <b>Celtic harp</b>, <b>folk harp</b> or the <b>lever harp</b>) comes from the design used in the Celtic cultral revivals of the 19th century. Mine is made by Camac and has 32 strings, some nylon, some metal.		</p>

        	<h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>I wanted to learn to play an instrument, and harp seemed easy to pick up. A good friend of my dad's is a harp player, and they encouraged my interest. Last summer, knowing I was planning on getting a harp, they generously gave me a new harp. I began lessons in October (the soonest I could find them)</p>
